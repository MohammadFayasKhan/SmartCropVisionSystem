"""
Image Quality Assessment & Foliar Preflight Module for SmartCropVision.
Evaluates uploaded leaf photography before expensive neural inference:
  • Laplacian variance for focal and motion blur detection
  • Illumination mean and dynamic range for exposure extremes
  • Excess Green Index (ExG) and color space analysis for botanical presence
  • Actionable feedback and recapture guidance to avoid false high-confidence predictions

Flow:
  Raw BGR Array → Grayscale Laplacian → Photometric Analysis → Vegetation Index → Quality Score

def assess_image_quality(img_bgr: np.ndarray) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Executes a comprehensive botanical image-quality audit on raw BGR leaf photography.

    Mathematical Basis:
      1. Blur: Laplacian variance Var(∇²I) measures high-frequency edge energy.
         ⤷ Low variance (< 45.0) indicates motion blur or out-of-focus camera capture.
      2. Illumination: Mean pixel intensity μ and standard deviation σ.
         ⤷ Severe underexposure (μ < 32.0) or overexposure (μ > 228.0) hides pathology symptoms.
         ⤷ Flat contrast (σ < 22.0) obscures subtle foliar lesion margins.
      3. Botanical Presence: Excess Green Index ExG = 2G - R - B and HSV hue thresholding.
         ⤷ Distinguishes actual plant leaves from non-agricultural objects or plain backgrounds.

    Returns:
      Dictionary matching the ImageQualityAssessment schema.
